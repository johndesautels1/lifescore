## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 What is LifeScore?

LifeScore is a web application that compares cities based on personal freedom metrics. Users select two cities and receive detailed analysis across six categories:

1. **Personal Autonomy** (20%) - Drugs, gambling, abortion, LGBTQ rights
2. **Housing & Property** (20%) - Zoning, HOA restrictions, land use
3. **Business & Work** (20%) - Licensing, employment laws, taxes
4. **Transportation** (15%) - Vehicle regulations, transit options
5. **Legal System** (15%) - Police enforcement, criminal justice
6. **Speech & Lifestyle** (10%) - Expression, privacy, cultural autonomy

### 2.2 How Scoring Works

Each city receives two scores per metric:
- **Legal Score (Law):** What the written law says (0-100)
- **Enforcement Score (Lived):** How laws are actually enforced (0-100)

Users can adjust the Law vs. Lived ratio to weight their results.

### 2.3 Available Cities

Currently, LifeScore supports **200 metropolitan areas**:
- 100 North American cities (USA + Canada)
- 100 European cities

*International expansion is planned for future releases.*

## 4. Common Customer Inquiries

### 4.1 "Why is my comparison taking so long?"

**Expected Response:**
"Enhanced comparisons analyze your cities across 100 metrics using multiple AI providers. This thorough analysis typically takes 5-8 minutes. You can track progress in the loading indicator. If it exceeds 10 minutes, please try refreshing the page."

**Root Causes:**
- Enhanced mode uses 5 LLM providers sequentially
- Each provider evaluates 100 metrics across 6 categories
- Network latency with AI providers
- High server load during peak times

### 4.2 "My results don't match my expectations"

**Expected Response:**
"LifeScore evaluates legal frameworks and their enforcement, which may differ from personal perceptions. Each score is backed by cited sources you can review in the Evidence panel. If you believe specific data is incorrect, please share the metric and we'll investigate."

**Actions:**
1. Direct user to expand the Evidence section for specific metrics
2. Explain Law vs. Lived scoring distinction
3. Note that enforcement varies by neighborhood/district
4. Offer to log feedback for data team review

### 4.3 "How current is your data?"

**Expected Response:**
"Our AI providers search for the most current legal information available, typically within the last 12-24 months. Laws passed or changed very recently may take time to appear in search results. Each evaluation includes source dates in the Evidence panel."

### 4.4 "Can you add [City Name]?"

**Expected Response:**
"Thank you for the suggestion! We're continuously expanding our city coverage. I've logged your request for [City Name]. Our team reviews city requests monthly and prioritizes based on user demand."

**Action:** Log city request in feedback system with user details.

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

### 5.1 Login Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Invalid email or password" | Verify email spelling; use "Forgot Password" link |
| "Email not verified" | Check spam folder; resend verification email |
| "Account locked" | Wait 30 minutes or contact support for unlock |
| Google/GitHub SSO failure | Clear cookies; try incognito mode |

### 5.2 Comparison Failures

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| "Evaluation timed out" | AI provider slow/unavailable | System auto-retries 3 times; if still failing, try again in 5 minutes |
| "Failed after 3 attempts" | Persistent provider issues | Wait 5 minutes and retry; the system attempted multiple retries automatically |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Too many requests | Wait 1 minute, retry |
| "API error" | Provider temporarily down | Try different comparison |
| "No data available" | Metrics couldn't be evaluated | Contact support |

**Note (Updated 2026-02-04):** Enhanced mode now includes automatic retry with exponential backoff for Gemini and Grok providers. The system will retry up to 3 times with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s) before reporting a failure.

**Note (Updated 2026-02-05):** Tavily web search timeout reduced from 240s to 45s for faster failure recovery. All save operations are now wrapped in try/catch to prevent silent failures.

### 5.3 Olivia AI Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Olivia not responding | Check internet; refresh page |
| Voice not playing | Check device volume; enable audio in browser |
| Incorrect answers | Report via feedback; AI has knowledge limitations |
| "Usage limit reached" | Upgrade tier or wait for monthly reset |

### 5.4 Video Generation Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Video stuck on "Generating" | Allow up to 90-180 seconds; refresh if longer |
| Video playback error | System auto-resets after 3 failed load attempts; click "SEE YOUR NEW LIFE!" to regenerate |
| "Video generation failed" | Retry; if persistent, contact support |
| Video shows blank/expired | Wait for auto-reset (after 3 errors) then regenerate |

**Note (Updated 2026-02-04):** "See Your New Life" videos now include automatic error detection. If video URLs have expired (common with cached videos), the system will detect load failures and automatically reset after 3 attempts, allowing users to regenerate fresh videos.

### 5.5 Gamma Report Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Report not generating | Ensure comparison completed first |
| "Generation ID missing" error | Fixed in Session 8 — the system now uses fallback ID from status response |
| PDF download fails | Try PPTX format instead; clear cache |
| Report shows wrong data | Regenerate from fresh comparison |

**Note (Updated 2026-02-05):** The "Generation ID missing" error has been resolved. Gamma reports and Judge reports are now also saved to Supabase (cloud backup) and visible in the Visual Reports / Saved tab.
