# CLUES Intelligence LTD — Trademark Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** February 28, 2026
**Classification:** INTERNAL — Admin Access Only

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the trademark registration strategy for Clues Intelligence LTD. It covers all marks requiring protection, filing jurisdictions, priority tiers, costs, and timelines.

**Current Status:** All marks are used with the ™ symbol (unregistered common law rights). No marks have been formally registered with any trademark office.

**Existing Common Law Protection:**
The site footer states: *"CLUES, SMART, and LIFE SCORE are trademarks of Clues Intelligence LTD."* This establishes common law (unregistered) trademark rights in jurisdictions where the marks are used in commerce, but formal registration provides significantly stronger protection.

## 2. Marks Requiring Protection

### 2.1 Tier 1 — Core Brand (Register Immediately)

These are the most critical marks. They should be registered first.

| Mark | Type | Description | Current Use |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **CLUES** | Word mark | Umbrella brand for all products | Active — company name, branding |
| **LIFE SCORE** | Word mark | First and flagship product | Active — live product |
| **SMART** | Word mark | Proprietary rating technology | Active — used in branding |

### 2.2 Tier 2 — Acronym Expansions (Register When Budget Allows)

These protect the full meaning behind each acronym and prevent competitors from using identical descriptors.

| Mark | Full Form | Type |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Comprehensive Location Utility & Evaluation System** | CLUES expansion | Tagline/descriptor |
| **Strategic Market Assessment & Rating Technology** | SMART expansion | Tagline/descriptor |
| **Legal Independence & Freedom Evaluation** | LIFE SCORE expansion | Tagline/descriptor |

### 2.3 Tier 3 — Product Module Names (Register at Launch)

Each module should be trademarked when it launches or shortly before. Filing all 19 at once is unnecessary and costly.

| Mark | Category | Register When |
|------|----------|---------------|
| FAITH SCORE | Religion & Spirituality | At launch |
| VOTE SCORE | Politics & Governance | At launch |
| PLAY SCORE | Parks & Recreation | At launch |
| GREEN SCORE | Environment & Sustainability | At launch |
| WORK SCORE | Employment & Economy | At launch |
| LEARN SCORE | Education & Schools | At launch |
| HEALTH SCORE | Healthcare & Wellness | At launch |
| SAFE SCORE | Crime & Safety | At launch |
| COST SCORE | Cost of Living | At launch |
| CONNECT SCORE | Internet & Infrastructure | At launch |
| CULTURE SCORE | Arts & Entertainment | At launch |
| FOOD SCORE | Dining & Cuisine | At launch |
| TRANSIT SCORE | Transportation | At launch |
| WEATHER SCORE | Climate & Weather | At launch |
| SOCIAL SCORE | Community & Demographics | At launch |
| STARTUP SCORE | Entrepreneurship | At launch |
| RETIRE SCORE | Retirement Living | At launch |
| FAMILY SCORE | Family-Friendliness | At launch |
| EXPAT SCORE | International Relocation | At launch |

### 2.4 Tier 4 — AI Persona Names (Consider Later)

Common first names are harder to register as trademarks. These should only be filed if the personas become significant brand identifiers with commercial recognition.

| Mark | Role | Registrability |
|------|------|----------------|
| **OLIVIA** | Client-Facing AI Expert | Moderate — common name, but used as a product identifier |
| **CRISTIANO** | AI Opus Judge | Moderate — common name |
| **EMILIA** | AI Architect & Troubleshooter | Moderate — common name |

**Note:** AI persona names can be protected through the IP Assignment Deed (already drafted at `docs/legal/IP_ASSIGNMENT_DEED.md`) even without formal trademark registration.

## 5. Cost Estimates

## 7. Key Considerations

### 7.1 "SCORE" Alone Is Not Registrable

The word "SCORE" by itself is too descriptive/generic for rating/comparison services. However, compound marks like "LIFE SCORE," "FAITH SCORE," etc. are registrable because they create a distinctive combination. Filing them as a **family of marks** strengthens each individual registration.

### 7.2 ™ vs ® Symbol Usage

| Symbol | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **™** | Unregistered trademark (common law) | Use NOW on all marks — no registration needed |
| **®** | Registered trademark | Use ONLY after registration is granted in that jurisdiction |

**Current footer text is correct:** Using "trademarks" (not "registered trademarks") and not using ® until marks are actually registered.

### 7.3 Priority Claims

If you file first in the UK, you have 6 months to file in the US/EU and claim the UK filing date as your priority date (Paris Convention). This is valuable — it means your UK filing date protects you internationally for 6 months.

### 7.4 Common Law Rights Already Established

By using CLUES, SMART, and LIFE SCORE in commerce (live product, website, marketing), you have already established common law trademark rights. These provide:

- **UK:** "Passing off" protection (common law)
- **US:** Common law trademark rights in areas where used
- **Limitations:** Harder to enforce, limited geographic scope, no ® symbol, no presumption of nationwide ownership

Formal registration removes all these limitations.

### 7.5 Descriptive vs. Distinctive

| Mark | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| CLUES | Low risk | Arbitrary for software services — strong mark |
| LIFE SCORE | Medium risk | Potentially descriptive for lifestyle comparison — argue it's suggestive |
| SMART | Medium risk | Common word, but arbitrary for rating technology |
| [X] SCORE modules | Medium risk | Suggestive marks — the combination is distinctive |

If the trademark office raises a descriptiveness objection, you can argue "acquired distinctiveness through use" or provide evidence of commercial use.

## 8. Existing IP Protection

The following IP protections are already in place:

| Protection | Document | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| IP Assignment Deed | `docs/legal/IP_ASSIGNMENT_DEED.md` | READY TO SIGN (wet-ink required) |
| Terms of Service IP clause | `docs/legal/TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` | ACTIVE |
| Footer trademark notice | `src/components/Footer.tsx` | ACTIVE |
| Copyright in source code | Automatic under UK law | ACTIVE |

### 8.1 What Still Needs Signing

The **IP Assignment Deed** (`docs/legal/IP_ASSIGNMENT_DEED.md`) assigns all intellectual property from John E. Desautels II to Clues Intelligence LTD. This must be:

1. Printed on paper
2. Signed in wet ink by John E. Desautels II (as both Assignor and Assignee director)
3. Witnessed by an independent adult
4. Stored securely (physical + scanned digital copy)

**This should be signed BEFORE filing any trademark applications**, as the company (not the individual) should be the trademark applicant.
